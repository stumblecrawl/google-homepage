# google-homepage

This is an attempt to reproduce the Google.com homepage, the simple one with the search box.  From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

The styling isn't perfect and it's not functional but all of the elemnts are there.

I had some struggles with positioning elemnts but finally made it workable.

The analogy I came up with while working on this project is this: Imagine looking at a $5 million home and trying to reproduce it with the crap lumber you have in your yard, a bucket of nails, a hammer, and a hand saw. At the end of the day it's not the same but I managed to put up four walls and a roof.
